**Task 1** : score prediction
What will be the predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hours per day by using Linear regression algorithm.
        
**Task 2** : Optimum number of clusters in Iris Dataset'\n'
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually by using Unsupervised Machine Learning.
        
**Task 3** : Decision Tree Classifier
This a Decision tree classifier for an Iris dataset, for any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly and visualize it  graphically.
